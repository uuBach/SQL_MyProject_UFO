/* Insights:
Sightings dramatically increased from the late 1990s to around 2012, peaking just before 2013. A sharp drop follows after that.

July has the highest number of reports, followed by August and June â€” suggesting a strong summer effect.

Most sightings occur in the evening, especially between 8 PM and 11 PM, indicating nighttime is the most common window for observations.
