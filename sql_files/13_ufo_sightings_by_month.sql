/*Insights:
July is the peak month for sightings, followed by August and June â€” indicating a strong summer spike.

Winter months (especially February and January) have the fewest reports, likely due to weather and reduced outdoor activity.

Overall, sightings increase with warmer weather and longer daylight, suggesting seasonality in observation or reporting behavior.
